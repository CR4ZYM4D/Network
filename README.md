A simple 3 layer feed forward neural network that employs the stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms 
along with the sigmoid activation function and L2 regularization techniques to recognize handwritten images from the MNIST dataset 
with an accuracy of about 98.5% written in python3.13. The cost function is a cross entropy error function and consists of 120 hidden neurons
